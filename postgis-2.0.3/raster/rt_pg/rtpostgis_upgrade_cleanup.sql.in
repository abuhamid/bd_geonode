-- This section is take add / drop things like CASTS, TYPES etc. that have changed
-- Since these are normally excluded from sed upgrade generator
-- they must be explicitly added
-- So that they can immediately be recreated. 
-- It is not run thru the sed processor to prevent it from being stripped
-- Note: We put these in separate file from drop since the extension module has
-- to add additional logic to drop them from the extension as well
